# Multi-Docs ChatBot using Llama2 :books:

This project is a document-based chatbot that uses the Llama2 model to generate responses based on the content of uploaded documents. It leverages the LangChain framework to manage conversational retrieval and document processing.

## Features

- **Document Upload**: Users can upload multiple documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT) for processing.
- **Conversational AI**: The chatbot interacts with users based on the contents of the uploaded documents.
- **Advanced NLP**: Utilizes embeddings and vector stores to efficiently retrieve relevant document sections.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_folder>
   ```

2. **Install the required Python packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Streamlit application**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. **Upload Documents**: Use the sidebar to upload PDF, DOCX, or TXT files.

3. **Ask Questions**: Interact with the chatbot by asking questions related to the uploaded documents.
